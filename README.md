# stockprediction
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether the closing price of Tesla stock will go up the next day based on historical stock market data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost, and a performance comparison to evaluate the most effective model.
# 🔍 Overview
The goal of this project is to use supervised machine learning algorithms to classify whether Tesla's stock closing price will increase the next day, based on features such as:

Open price

High price

Low price

Close price

# 🧠 Key Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes trends, distributions, and outliers in the dataset.

🧼 Preprocessing: Handles missing values, irrelevant columns, and feature scaling.

🏋️ Model Training: Implements and compares three ML models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine

XGBoost Classifier

📉 Performance Metrics: Accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices are used to evaluate model performance.

📌 Visualization: Plots for closing prices, histograms, boxplots, and confusion matrix heatmaps.

# 🔮 Future Development
Integrate LSTM or Transformer models for advanced time series forecasting.

Incorporate technical indicators and real-time financial news sentiment analysis.

Use Reinforcement Learning to simulate and optimize trading strategies.

Apply AutoML tools for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

Improve evaluation using time-aware validation and financial metrics like Sharpe ratio.
